    \caption{
    \ce{CH4}/Ar (\textit{top}) and \ce{CO2}/Ar (\textit{bottom}) ratios in well P201.
    Vertical dashed lines mark the timing of the Arolla and Sanetsch earthquakes.
    Red hues highlight deviations in gas ratios occurring in the days preceding each event.
    Subtile decreases in \ce{CH4}/Ar and increases in \ce{CO2}/Ar are observed around both events.

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{chapters/06_appendix/SI_C3/full_EuD_7.pdf}
    \caption{
    EuD values for \ce{CO2}/Ar versus \ce{CH4}/Ar in wells P201 (blue) and P600 (red), computed using a 7-day interval from September 2021 to January 2025.
    Shaded areas indicate propagated uncertainties.
    The secondary y-axis displays earthquake magnitudes (M$_w \geq 2.0$) within \SI{50}{\kilo\meter} of Lavey-les-Bains; point color denotes epicentral distance (warmer hues = closer proximity).
    The gray band represents a fixed noise threshold of 0.025, used due to variable baseline uncertainty.

    \caption{
    Distribution of time lag between EuD maxima in well P600 and regional earthquakes (red, observed data; M$_w \geq 2.0$, within \SI{50}{\kilo\meter} of Lavey-les-Bains), compared to a synthetic distribution of randomly generated earthquakes (grey, synthetic data; \num{10000} iterations).
    A maximum time lag threshold of \SI{18}{\day} was applied to both distributions.
    Negative values indicate that EuD maxima occurred before the corresponding earthquake, and positive values indicate they occurred after.
    Both distributions are centered on zero.
